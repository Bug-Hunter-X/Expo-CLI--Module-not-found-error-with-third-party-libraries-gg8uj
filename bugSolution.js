The solution depends on the library's requirements.  Here are some common approaches:

1. **Verify Installation:** Double-check that you installed the library correctly using `expo install react-native-uncommon-lib` (replace with your library name). 

2. **Check Compatibility:** Ensure the library is compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Check the library's documentation and compatibility notes.

3. **Use Expo-compatible alternatives:** Some libraries might have dedicated Expo versions, often with the naming convention including `expo` or similar. Look for alternatives that have been designed for compatibility with the Expo managed workflow.

4. **(If necessary) Explore EAS Build (for advanced cases):** If you absolutely need a library that isn't Expo-compatible and straightforward linking isn't possible,  consider building your app using EAS Build.  This gives you more control over the build process, enabling you to integrate native modules more flexibly but will require more advanced build configuration. 

**Example (Corrected):**
```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// ... (Assuming 'react-native-uncommon-lib-expo' is the Expo-compatible version) ...
import UncommonComponent from 'react-native-uncommon-lib-expo';

// ... rest of your component ...
<UncommonComponent />
```
