This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or component from a library that isn't properly installed or linked in your Expo project.  For example, if you're using a library that requires native modules, and it's not correctly set up within your Expo managed workflow, you'll encounter issues like this.  The specific error message may vary, but often involves a module not found error.

Example (using a hypothetical library 'react-native-uncommon-lib'):
```javascript
import UncommonComponent from 'react-native-uncommon-lib';

// ... later in your component ...
<UncommonComponent />
```
If `react-native-uncommon-lib` isn't correctly integrated (perhaps it needs a `expo install` and linking steps or is incompatible with the Expo SDK version), this code will fail.
